# Why do we use `--esModuleInterop`

We use `lodash`. `lodash` modules are CommonJS modules. We import them as 
`import * as smth`. Typescript warns us that itâ€™s not a great way. 
To remove them we had put the `ts-ignore` tag. 

We can use `--esModuleInterop` to eliminate the problem without workarounds
like `ts-ignore`:
